# Bash, curl and working with web API

## Overview

One of the benefits of the Bash shell (and other Unix shells) is it provides a great deal
of capability right out of the box. When you combine that with other Unix tools you have
a powerful environment for text processing and manipulation.

## What is covered

In this tutorial we assume you have some knowledge of Unix basics

+ How to start the Bash shell (e.g. 'Terminal' on Mac OS X)
+ How to list, view, copy, move and delete files and directories

We'll be expanding on that basic knowledge with a discussion of

+ Commannd history and command line editing
+ Working environment variable
    + remembering things for later
    + simple text manipulation
+ Building complex pipe lines
+ Making decisions
+ Repeating things
+ Simple templated text output with Bash (advanced uses of redirection and cat)

Additionally we will be using two new programs you may not be familiar with

+ curl - for retrieving and interacting with content from the web
+ sed - a automated editor (stream editor) for manipulating text
+ cut - a tool for working with column oriented data
+ paste - a tool for putting text side by side
+ join - a tool for combining things
+ jq - a tool for working with JSON data
