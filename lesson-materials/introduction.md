# Bash, curl and working with web API

## Overview

One of the benefits of the Bash shell (and other Unix shells) is it provides a great deal
of capability right out of the box. When you combine that with other Unix tools you have
a powerful environment for text processing and data manipulation.

## What will be covered?

In this tutorial we assume you have some knowledge of Unix basics

+ How to start the Bash shell (e.g. 'Terminal' on Mac OS X)
+ How to open an edit a file
+ How to list, view, copy, move and delete files and directories
+ How to page through a view with `more` or `less`

This tutorial is focused on building on that basic knowledge and will cover--

+ Command history and command line editing
+ Working environment variable
    + remembering things for later
    + simple text manipulation
+ Building complex pipe lines
+ Creating simple text templates with Bash using cat and file redirection
+ Making decisions
+ Repeating things
+ Working with plan text formats
+ Introducing working with XML data
+ Introducing working with JSON data

We will be cover in modest detail some of the following utilities--

+ find - a command for locating and listing files and directories
+ curl - for retrieving and interacting with content from the web
+ sed - a automated editor (stream editor) for manipulating text
+ cut - a tool for working with column oriented data
+ ??paste - a tool for putting text side by side
+ ??join - a tool for combining things
+ jq - a tool for working with JSON data
