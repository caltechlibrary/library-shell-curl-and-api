# Approaches to cleaning and reporting

+ best practice, keep your raw data, create derivatives
+ `find`-ing what you've downloaded
    + find by type
    + find by name
    + find combined with grep to get files by extension
+ Aggregate by applying loops, choices and pipelines
+ filters and aggregation
    + `grep`
    + `sed` (and maybe `awk`)
    + `sort`
    + `cut`, `paste` and `join`
+ Open Refine

Cleanup is one of the most time consume areas in data science. The more tools you
can bring to bare on this problem the more options you have to get through this
quickly.
