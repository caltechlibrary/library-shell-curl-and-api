+ common variables you may already have
    + $USER
    + $HOME
    + $PATH
+ set, unset and accessing the variable
    + variables are remember as a sequence of characters
    + also called a "string"
    + you can see the contents of a variable with `echo`
    + you can list all the variables available with `env`
    + context
        + local vs. global
        + export
+ clever extras, working with variables as "strings"
    + pulling out parts of a string
    + simple find and replace
    + composing longer strings
